# Group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history

# Overview:
This project aims to implement a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains relevant information about customer transactions.

# Dataset:
The dataset can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python

# Model used:
The K-means clustering algorithm is employed for customer segmentation in this project. K-means is a widely used unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data points into K clusters based on their similarity. It iteratively assigns data points to clusters in a way that minimizes the within-cluster sum of squares.
